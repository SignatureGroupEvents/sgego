- **Role Management**: Admins can update user roles
- **Event Assignment**: Assign staff to specific events/programs
- **User Deactivation**: Safely deactivate users (admin only)

- Automatic filtering in EventsList, SidebarEventsList, and Dashboard
- Seamless user experience with proper access control

## Usage Examples

### For Staff Users
1. Navigate to Profile to view/edit personal information
2. Only assigned events appear in the events list
3. Can perform check-ins and inventory logging for assigned events

### For Operations Managers
1. Access Profile to manage all users
2. Create new staff accounts
3. Assign staff to specific events
4. Manage events and inventory

### For Administrators
1. Full user management capabilities
2. Can create any type of user account
3. Can assign any role to users
4. Can deactivate or delete users
5. Complete system oversight

## Security Considerations

- All user management endpoints are protected with authentication
- Role-based middleware ensures proper access control
- Password changes require current password verification
- User deletion checks for existing activity before allowing
- Assignment tracking provides audit trail

## Database Schema

### UserAssignment Collection
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId (ref: User),
  eventId: ObjectId (ref: Event),
  assignedBy: ObjectId (ref: User),
  isActive: Boolean,
  assignedAt: Date,
  timestamps: true
}
```

### Enhanced User Collection
```javascript
{
  email: String (unique),
  username: String (unique),
  password: String (hashed),
  role: String (enum: ['admin', 'operations_manager', 'staff']),
  lastLogin: Date,
  isActive: Boolean,
  timestamps: true
}
```

## Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages for all operations
- Validation for email/username uniqueness
- Graceful handling of permission errors
- User-friendly error display in UI
- Proper HTTP status codes for all responses
